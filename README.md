# ðŸ’³ Analyzing E-commerce Business Performance

Welcome to my project on **Analyzing E-commerce Business Performance**! ðŸ˜Š This project focuses on leveraging **SQL** to explore and analyze key aspects of an e-commerce business. The goal is to extract meaningful insights that can drive strategic decision-making.

---

## ðŸš€ Introduction

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce company's performance using SQL. The analysis is divided into three main sections:

1. **Annual Customer Activity Growth Analysis**  
2. **Annual Product Category Quality Analysis**  
3. **Analysis of Annual Payment Type Usage**  

By breaking down these aspects, we gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and payment trends over time.

## ðŸ“Š Data Overview

The dataset used in this project includes transaction records from an e-commerce platform, featuring information such as:

- **Customer IDs** and **demographics**
- **Product categories** and **sales figures**
- **Payment types** used for transactions
- **Transaction dates** and **order statuses**

The data was cleaned and prepared using SQL queries to ensure accuracy and consistency before performing the analysis.
